today i was leaning data types and variables:

variables and containers that will help to store our datas.

ippo example , fish nratha oru container la poduvom and dog na atha oru container la poduvom.
but cat eduthutu poitu poda mudiyathu right , in the same manner,

if we store the number in container means that is called variable and the data is which type it is an  integer correc ahh so , that time we want to mention the datatype 
"int" it  is called datatype.

avlothaaa!
