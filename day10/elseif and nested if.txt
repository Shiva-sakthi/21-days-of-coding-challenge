else if :

if else is used after an if statement and before an optional else statement to ttest the multiple conditions sequentially.

simply says generally if conditions works on each block even the conditioon is true on initial stage
so instead of this we use else if conditions even though the first codition is true means it won't check another conditions
that's it.

nested if :

simply This nesting allows you to check for multiple conditions in a hierarchical manner, where the inner if statement is executed only if the condition of the outer if statement is true. It's a powerful feature for handling complex decision-making processes.

one if inside the another if condition whether it is a powerful for making a multiple decision.
