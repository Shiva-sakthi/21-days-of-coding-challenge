on this day try to solve some problems of what we learned before ,ok let's start!

the first question is get the user from the input :

sample input:
jhon 
45

output:
my name is jhon 
my age is 45

now in this will add extra some variable address:

my name is siva
my age is 34
my address is . this the output actually i got,

in this output the address is not printed
why because , whenever we declare the string after the integer that time the string takes the empty line of the output of intger,
simply says ,genrally the output works line basis right , if example the age is 34 right it prints 34 but remain the blank line are going to next line 
thats why it does not ask the input. so to avoid this we can use "scan.nextLine()"
so automattically the line will store on this scanner hereafter the next msy ask thec input.


final result:

my name is siva
my age is 34
my address is chennai
