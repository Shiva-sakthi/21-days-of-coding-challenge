first of all the the memory is two types :

1. stack 
2. heap:
in haep la there are two types :
string pool , object


in string comparator

 okkk let's see object first:
  in object if we store an string means 
  eg: a= one and b=one  means i said it is in object 
  in object each string stored in differrebnt address so generally the java checks the address only not the content so the 
  we are using the if (a==b) means it shows "flase"
  why because it check the reference
  
  in  string pool means it gives true because in string pool 
  eg : a= apple and  b= apple means a and b pointing the same address so its check and shows true.

avlotha!!
